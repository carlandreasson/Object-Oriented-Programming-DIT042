# Object-Oriented-Programming-DIT042
The course is a part of the Software Engineering and Management program at Gothenburg University and Chalmers University of Technology. 

The course introduces the student to a contemporary object-oriented programming language with associated platforms and environments, with emphasis on basic programming language concepts, object oriented concepts, and elementary data structures. For this version, we will use Java as the main programming language during lectures, exercises, assignments and exam. Examples of topics covered in this course are:

- Programming basics: Types, input/output, conditional loops, arrays, scope, etc.
- Object-oriented programming: Classes, objects, polymorphism, inheritance, interfaces.
- Java APIs, good practices in OO and Java programming, Exceptions, I/O streams.
